        My journey into web development started with The School of Code in
        November 2021. Before discovering my love for coding, I was working as
        an English language teacher for 2 years, however I was looking to
        challenge myself and learn something new that could lead to a career I
        feel excited about!
        <br />
        <br />
        After an intense 16-weeks at The School of Code, I learned the technical
        and interpersonal skills necessary to start a career in web development.
        During the bootcamp I was exposed to a wide range of technologies and
        developed my soft skills all while learning and collaborating remotely.
        Iâ€™m excited to continue learning more and to enter a field that inspires
        me!
        <br />
        <br />
        As well as coding and learning new tech, I love surfing, learning
        Spanish, cooking and hiking!
